IoT Final Project Setup Instructions

Requirements:
This project requires matlab to be installed on your computer, & at least 2 micro:bits. Matlab version R2023b 
was used for the project, but there shouldn't be any version specific requirements.

Physical Setup:
1. Connect one micro:bit to your computer via usb to act as the micro:bit gateway.
2. Connect 1 to 3 more micro:bits to any computer in the vacinity to provide power to the micro:bits.

Matlab Setup:
Simply run gateway.m in matlab on the computer with the gateway micro:bit connected.

Micro:bit Gateway Setup:
1. On the computer with the gateway micro:bit connected, go to https://python.microbit.org/v/3 using the chrome
browser. Other browsers are not supported by the website.
2. If you are not prompted to connect the micro:bit, select the 3 dots on the bottom left & hit connect. Select
your microbit.
3. Copy the code from gateway.py into the browser editor. 
4. On the bottom left select 'project' & 'create file' name the file 'accesscom' & select create. Copy the code from 'accessCom.py' to the new file.
5.Select main.py & 'Send to micro:bit' to flash the device.

Micro:bit Node Setup:
1. On each computer with a node micro:bit connected go to https://python.microbit.org/v/3 using the chrome browser.
If the controller micro:bit is connected on the same computer, be sure to open a new tab.
2. If you are not prompted to connect the micro:bit, select the 3 dots on the bottom left & hit connect. Select
your microbit.
3. Copy the code from 'gateway.py' to the browser.
4. On the bottom left select 'project' & 'create file' name the file 'accesscom' & select create. Copy the code from 'accessCom.py' to the new file.
5.Select main.py & 'Send to micro:bit' to flash the device.
