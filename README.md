My portion of my Internet of Things final project from the Summer 2023 school term. This is a custom IoT protocol
written in micro python & matlab. My partner's code has been removed, however everything except communication with the
MQTT broker is working. This includes the gateway & node communication.

This project is designed to work with micro:bits acting as nodes. See the setup instructions file for instructions to set
up the project & flash the micro:bits if you want to run the code.
